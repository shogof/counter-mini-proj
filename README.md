# React Counter Component 📝✨

## Project Description 🧠

### 🎨 **React Counter Component**

I’m excited to present my latest project: a React Counter Component! This component features a straightforward counter with buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the count. Designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, this project highlights fundamental React principles and provides an example of managing state and handling user interactions effectively.
